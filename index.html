    <p>Matteo Ferraro is driven by a passion for fostering the growth of others. As a student leader at New Jersey Institute of Technology, he actively supported the campus community. Embracing an ethos of paying-it-forward and valuing active citizenship and education, led him to become an Adjunct Instructor at his alma mater. For the past three years, Matteo has worked at Shore Point Architecture, PA, on residential and commercial projects. There, Matteo advocated launching a mentorship program for the firm’s emerging professionals. “MentoringMatters” created a framework for senior staff to transition knowledge and discuss critical topics. After completing his NCARB’s AXP requirement, New Jersey removed the supplemental experience requirements to begin the Architect Registration Exam (ARE). Matteo aimed to accelerate his timeline and complete all six divisions in less than a year - prior to when he would have initially been eligible to start. Matteo met his goal in July 2024. Currently, Matteo is attending Southern California Institute of Architecture’s (SCI-Arc) post-graduate M.S. Design Theory and Pedagogy program – to advance his career in Architectural Education. Now licensed, he aspires to pay it forward to others on their licensure journey and is working to develop a licensure preparation course.</p>
